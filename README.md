# dots

My personal collection of "dotfiles" for workstation configuration.

Feel free to fork this repo and change it to your liking for your own configuration -- use at your own risk; I am not responsible for any damages etc. from your use of this repo.

## Usage

1. Clone to an appropriate place, such as `~/dots`
1. Run `~/dots/apply`

If you have local files that conflict with those in the repo (very likely), you can pass the `-f` flag to `apply` which will rename those files with a `.bkp` on the end and apply these files instead.
